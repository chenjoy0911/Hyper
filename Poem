Facing the Sea With Spring Blossoms

From tomorrow on, I will be a happy person;
Grooming, chopping, and traveling all over the world.

From tomorrow on, I will care foodstuff and vegetables,
I have a house,towards the sea, with spring flowers blossoming.

From tomorrow on, I will write to each of my dear ones,
Telling them of my happiness,
What the lightening of blessedness has told me,
I will spread it to each of them.

And give a warm name for every river and every mountain.

Strangers, I will also give you my well-wishing.

May you have a brilliant future!

May you lovers eventually become spouse!

May you enjoy happiness in this earthly world!

I only wish to face the sea, with spring flowers blossoming.

从明天起，做一个幸福的人,
喂马，劈柴，周游世界.
从明天起，关心粮食和蔬菜,
我有一所房子，面朝大海，春暖花开.
从明天起，和每一个亲人通信,
告诉他们我的幸福,
那幸福的闪电告诉我的,
我将告诉每一个人.
给每一条河每一座山取一个温暖的名字.
陌生人，我也为你祝福.
愿你有一个灿烂的前程!
愿你有情人终成眷属!
愿你在尘世获得幸福!
我只愿面朝大海，春暖花开.
